            <p>Midjourney Prompter: <a href="https://midjourneyprompterapp.streamlit.app/">Midjourney Prompter</a>A clone of the old Jidjourney prompter app that was written by Shane McGeehan. I always enjoyed using it. He said it became too much to keep up with new features. Eventually took it offline I wanted to use it, so I used AI to "clone" itâ€”even though it's offline!</p>
